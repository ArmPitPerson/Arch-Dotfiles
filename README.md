This repository contains the dotfiles i use for my current setup of Arch Linux. They will be updated as my current setup is changed, and should always represent the image below:

## Environment information
 * bspwm
 * lemonbar
 * zsh
 * compton

## Info
Run the install script while cd-ed into the root folder of this repo. It should symlink everything to sensible locations
(~/ and ~/.config/) for your convenience. Other than that, wal must be set up using blorange theme and the wallpaper.
